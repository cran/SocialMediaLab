\title{
Create semantic networks from social media data (semantic relationships between concepts)
}
\description{
This function creates a semantic network from social media data (i.e. from data frames of class \code{dataSource}, or for Twitter data it is also possible to provide a *list* of data frames). In such semantic networks, concepts are words/terms extracted from the text corpus of social media data (e.g. tweets on Twitter).
}
\usage{
CreateSemanticNetwork(x, writeToFile, termFreq, hashtagFreq,
  removeTermsOrHashtags, stopwordsEnglish)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    a data frame of class \code{dataSource}. For Twitter data, it is also possible to provide a *list* of data frames (i.e. data frames that inherit class \code{dataSource} and \code{twitter}). Only lists of Twitter data frames are supported at this time. If a list of data frames is provided, then the function binds these row-wise and computes over the entire data set.
  }
  \item{writeToFile}{
    logical. If \code{TRUE} then the network is saved to file in current working directory (GRAPHML format), with filename denoting the current date/time and the type of network.
  }
  \item{termFreq}{
    numeric integer, specifying the percentage of most frequent TERMS to include. For example, a value of 20 means that the 20% most frequently occurring terms will be included in the semantic network. The default value is 5, meaning the 5% most frequent terms are used.
  }
  \item{hashtagFreq}{
    ** NOT IMPLEMENTED YET - DEFAULTS TO ALL HASHTAGS **. numeric integer, specifying the percentage of most frequent HASHTAGS to include. For example, a value of 80 means that the 80% most frequently occurring hashtags will be included in the semantic network. The default value is 50, meaning the 50% most frequent hashtags are used.
  }
  \item{removeTermsOrHashtags}{
    character vector. Default is none. Otherwise this argument specifies which terms or hashtags (i.e. vertices with matching `name`) should be removed from the semantic network. This is useful to remove the search term or hashtag that was used to collect the data (i.e. remove the corresponding vertex in the graph). For example, a value of "#auspol" means that if there is a vertex with the name "#auspol" then this vertex will be removed.
  }
  \item{stopwordsEnglish}{
    logical. If \code{TRUE} then English stopwords are removed from the tweets (e.g. words such as 'the' or 'and'). Using \code{FALSE} may be helpful non-English data sets. The default is \code{TRUE} (i.e. stopwords will be removed).
  }
}
\details{
This function creates a weighted network from a data frame of class \code{dataSource} (which are created using the `CollectData` family of functions in the SocialMediaLab package), or a *list* of Twitter data frames collected using \code{CollectDataTwitter} function.

The resulting semantic network is an igraph graph object. This graph object is semantic because vertices represent unique concepts (in this case unique terms/words extracted from a social media text corpus), and edges represent the co-occurrence of terms for all observations in the data set. For example, for a Twitter semantic network, vertices represent either hashtags (e.g. "#auspol") or single terms ("politics"). If there are 1500 tweets in the data set (i.e. 1500 observations), and the term "#auspol" and the term "politics" appear together in every tweet, then this will be represented by an edge with weight equal to 1500.
}
\value{
An igraph graph object, with weighted edges.

\note{
Not all data sources in SocialMediaLab can be used for creating semantic networks.

Currently supported data sources are:

- Twitter

Other data sources (e.g. YouTube and Facebook) will be implemented in the future. Additionally, the user is notified if they try to create semantic networks for incompatible data sources.

For Twitter data, semantic networks can be created from multiple data frames (i.e. datasets collected individually using CollectDataTwitter). Simply create a list of the data frames that you wish to create a network from. For example, \code{myList <- list(myTwitterData1, myTwitterData2, myTwitterData3)}.

\dontrun{
  ## This example shows how to collect Twitter data and create a semantic network

  # Firstly specify your API credentials
  my_api_key <- "1234567890qwerty"
  my_api_secret <- "1234567890qwerty"
  my_access_token <- "1234567890qwerty"
  my_access_token_secret <- "1234567890qwerty"

  # Authenticate with the Twitter API using \code{AuthenticateWithTwitterAPI}
  AuthenticateWithTwitterAPI(api_key=my_api_key, api_secret=my_api_secret,
    access_token=my_access_token, access_token_secret=my_access_token_secret)

  # Collect tweets data using \code{myTwitterData}
  myTwitterData <- CollectDataTwitter(searchTerm="#auspol",
    numTweets=200,writeToFile=FALSE,verbose=FALSE)

  # Create a 'semantic' network using \code{CreateSemanticNetwork}
  g_semantic_twitter <- CreateSemanticNetwork(myTwitterData,writeToFile=FALSE,
    termFreq=20,hashtagFreq=80)
