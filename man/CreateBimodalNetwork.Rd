\title{Create bimodal networks from social media data}
\usage{
CreateBimodalNetwork(x, writeToFile, removeTermsOrHashtags)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a data frame of class \code{dataSource}. For Twitter data, it is
also possible to provide a *list* of data frames (i.e. data frames that
inherit class \code{dataSource} and \code{twitter}). Only lists of Twitter
data frames are supported at this time. If a list of data frames is
provided, then the function binds these row-wise and computes over the
entire data set.}

\item{writeToFile}{logical. If \code{TRUE} then the network is saved to file
in current working directory (GRAPHML format), with filename denoting the
current date/time and the type of network.}

\item{removeTermsOrHashtags}{character vector. Default is none. Otherwise
this argument specifies which terms or hashtags (i.e. vertices with matching
`name`) should be removed from the bimodal network. This is useful to remove
the search term or hashtag that was used to collect the data (i.e. remove
the corresponding vertex in the graph). For example, a value of "#auspol"
means that if there is a vertex with the exact name "#auspol" then this
vertex will be removed.}
}
\value{
An igraph graph object, with weighted and directed edges.
}
\description{
This function creates a bimodal network from social media data (i.e. from
data frames of class \code{dataSource}, or for Twitter data it is also
possible to provide a *list* of data frames), with edges representing
relationships between actors of two different types (e.g. Facebook users and
Facebook posts, with edges representing whether a user has commented or
'liked' a post).
}
\details{
This function creates a (directed and weighted) bimodal network from a data
frame of class \code{dataSource} (which are created using the `CollectData`
family of functions in the SocialMediaLab package), or a *list* of Twitter
data frames collected using \code{CollectDataTwitter} function.

The resulting network is an igraph graph object. This graph object is
bimodal because edges represent relationships between vertices of two
different types. For example, in a bimodal Facebook network, vertices
represent Facebook users or Facebook posts, and edges represent whether a
user has commented or 'liked' a post. Edges are directed and weighted (e.g.
if user i has commented n times on post j, then the weight of this directed
edge equals n).
}
\note{
Not all data sources in SocialMediaLab can be used for creating
bimodal networks.

Currently supported data sources are:

- Facebook - Twitter

Other data sources (e.g. YouTube) will be implemented in the future.
Additionally, the user is notified if they try to create bimodal networks
for incompatible data sources.

For Twitter data, bimodal networks can be created from multiple data frames
(i.e. datasets collected individually using CollectDataTwitter). Simply
create a list of the data frames that you wish to create a network from. For
example, \code{myList <- list(myTwitterData1, myTwitterData2,
myTwitterData3)}.

\examples{
\dontrun{
  ## This example shows how to collect Facebook page data and create a bimodal network

  # Use your own values for myAppID and myAppSecret
  myAppID <- "123456789098765"
  myAppSecret <- "abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123ab"

  # Authenticate with the Facebook API using `AuthenticateWithFacebookAPI`
  fb_oauth <- AuthenticateWithFacebookAPI(appID=myAppID, appSecret=myAppSecret,
    extended_permissions=FALSE, useCachedToken=TRUE)

  # Run the `CollectDataFacebook` function and store the results in variable `myFacebookData`
  myFacebookData <- CollectDataFacebook(pageName="StarWars", rangeFrom="2014-05-15",
  rangeTo="2014-06-03",writeToFile=FALSE,verbose=TRUE)

  # Create a 'bimodal' network using \\code{CreateBimodalNetwork}
  g_bimodal_facebook <- CreateBimodalNetwork(myFacebookData)

  # View descriptive information about the bimodal network
  g_bimodal_facebook
