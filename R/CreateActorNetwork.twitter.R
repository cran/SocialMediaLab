    # The 'users_mentioned' column in the 'df' dataframe is slightly problematic (i.e. not straightforward)
    # because each row in this column contains a LIST, itself containing 1 or more char vectors (which are 'mentions' of usernames, or if no mentions then empty).
    # (Note: this improves on previous approaches that only take the FIRST pattern match of a 'mention' in any given tweet text).
    # So, need to extract each list item out, and put it into its own row in a new dataframe:

    for (i in 1:nrow(df)) {
      if (length(df$users_mentioned[[i]]) > 0) { # skip any rows where NO USERS were mentioned
        for (j in 1:length(df$users_mentioned[[i]])) {

        }

    dfActorNetwork1 <- data.frame(usersTemp, mentionedUsersTemp)

    # OK, now extract only the UNIQUE pairs (i.e. rows)
    # But, also create a WEIGHT value for multiple mentions between users
        # NOTE: This edge weights approach might be problematic for TEMPORAL actor networks, because each edge (with weight > 1) represents mentions in tweets at DIFFERENT TIMES.
        # NOTE: A possible workaround could be to include an edge attribute that is a set of timestamp elements, showing the date/time of each unique 'mention'.
        # NOTE: For example, in a temporal visualisation, the first timestamp might 'pop in' the edge to the graph, which then might start to 'fade out' over time (or just 'pop out' of graph after N seconds) if there are no more timestamps indicating activity (i.e. mentions) between the two users.
        # NOTE: So, a 'timestamps' edge attribute could factor into a kind of 'entropy' based approach to evolving the network visually over time.

    # unique pairs:
